This ETF tracks the S&P 500 Index, which includes many large and well known U.S. firms. As a result, investors should think of this as a play on mega and large cap stocks in the American market. These securities are usually known as \u2018Blue Chips\u2019 and are some of the most famous and profitable companies in the country, including well known names such as ExxonMobil, Apple, IBM , and GE. Given this focus, IVV has obvious appeal as a core holding in a long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio; it offers cheap and relatively balanced exposure to many of the world\u2019s largest companies, giving investors a way to own a basket of companies that makes up a sizable portion of global market cap. For investors seeking exposure to the S&P 500 Index, there are multiple ETFs from which to choose. The largest is SPY , but IVV has some structural advantages over the ultra-popular SPDR . SPY is a UIT , an outdated structure that differs slightly from true 1940 Act ETFs such as IVV . This fund has the ability to lend out share (thereby generating some additional revenues) and to reinvest dividends (which can add value if markets generally trend up). As such, IVV is probably a better choice than SPY for those seeking exposure to large cap U.S. stocks as part of a long-term strategy. SPY\u2019s more liquid options market may make it useful for those implementing more advanced short-term strategies. Another alternative is VOO , which is slightly cheaper and is eligible for commission free trading within Vanguard accounts. Beyond the S&P 500, RSP may be another alternative worth a closer look; that ETF , which is a bit more expensive, holds all stocks in the S&P 500 but gives an equivalent weighting to each. As such, it might be attractive to investors looking to steer clear of the potential inefficiencies in market cap weighting methodologies."}, {"symbol": "SPY", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$677.62", "average_volume": "82,407,250", "name": "State Street SPDR S&P 500 ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SPY/", "one_year_return": "-0.63%", "description": "SPY is one of the largest and most heavily-traded ETFs in the world, offering exposure to one of the most well known equity benchmarks. While SPY certainly may have appeal to investors seeking to build a long-term portfolio and include large cap U.S. stocks, this fund has become extremely popular with more active traders as a way to toggle between risky and safe assets. A look at SPY\u2019s daily turnover reveals the short average holding period and the popularity with active traders. For those seeking to establish exposure to large cap U.S. stocks, the liquidity of SPY (including the deep options market) is unrivaled. Spreads are always very narrow, and investors can move in and out of this fund with ease. But for those looking to establish a longer-term portfolio, there may be better options within the Large Cap Blend ETFdb Category. In fact, other ETFs targeting the S&P 500 may be more appealing for buy-and-holders. Vanguard\u2019s VOO is cheaper by a few basis points, while iShares\u2019 IVV is another option. The advantage of these funds is structural in nature; SPY is a UIT , which means it doesn\u2019t maintain the flexibility to lend out shares or reinvest dividends. Over the long run, those limitations may allow true ETFs such as VOO and IVV to add a few additional basis points to the bottom line. Another potentially intriguing alternative is RSP , which holds the same companies as SPY but assigns an equal weighting to each. Historically, RSP has performed quite well, generating alpha with surprising consistency. SPY is a fine ETF , and is particularly useful for those looking to execute a trade quickly and efficiently.

Of course, this fund can certainly be useful as part of a buy-and-hold approach for investors looking to maintain a tilt towards the potentially volatile tech sector. The composition of QQQ is certainly unique; this fund maintains a hefty allocation to technology companies, resulting in potentially significant volatility through heightened exposure to a sector that has historically experienced both impressive rallies and devastating busts.

Others may wish to include gold exposure as part of a long-term investment strategy. GLD is a relatively straightforward product; the underlying assets consist of gold bullion stored in secure vaults. As such, the price of this ETF can be expected to move in lock step with spot gold prices. The physically-backed nature of this product eliminates any of the uncertainties introduced through futures-based strategies, though investors also have the option to approach this precious metal through futures-based funds such as UBG and DGL . The primary alternatives to GLD are other physically-backed gold ETFs, including AGOL , SGOL , and IAU . The first two on that list may appeal to investors looking to vault their gold outside of New York and London; AGOL stores bullion in Singapore, while SGOL\u2019s vaults are located in Switzerland. IAU is, in our opinion, represents a better way to play gold through the exchange-traded structure. While the underlying assets are similar and interchangeable, the expense ratios on these two funds are not. IAU is cheaper by 15 basis points; that margin isn\u2019t enormous, but is enough to essentially guarantee that GLD will lag behind IAU in terms of performance. Investors in IAU give up very little in the way of liquidity (that fund is massive as well) and will add a few basis points to their bottom lines.

It is more likely to be useful to investors who want to overlay a quality tilt on top of a core allocation to U.S. markets. There has been a proliferation of factor funds in recent years, and investors can compare QUAL to rivals like the Xtrackers Russell 1000 US Quality at a Reasonable Price ETF ( QARP ), the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Cap Company Index ETF ( FNDX ), or the JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF ( JQUA ). Cost-conscious investors might prefer ultra-low-cost plain vanilla U.S. funds like the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF ( VTI ) or the iShares S&P 500 ETF ( IVV )."}, {"symbol": "IWR", "asset_class":

EEM certainly qualifies as a portfolio \u201cbuilding block\u201d given the importance of the asset class covered, but it also has some noteworthy flaws. In terms of the exposure offered, there is a lot to like about EEM ; the underlying portfolio includes hundreds of stocks from dozens of different emerging markets. Though there are some significant allocations to certain sectors, EEM is generally very well balanced. It should be noted that EEM consists almost entirely of large cap stocks; those looking to round out emerging markets exposure should like funds such as EEMS and EWX as complementary positions. The biggest drawback is the significant expense ratio; EEM is considerably more expensive than VWO , a Vanguard fund that is linked to the exact same index. That means that this ETF is destined to lag behind that alternative in terms of bottom line performance. It should be noted, however, that EEM has a very active options market. So while VWO is generally a better choice for buy-and-holders, this iShares fund can be useful for those looking to implement more advanced strategies that include options.

Like rivals including State Street\u2019s popular Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLK ) and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT ), FTEC also owns sizable slugs of Visa and Mastercard. Launched in 2013, FTEC has amassed less than $3 billion in assets while its pricier rivals XLK and VGT manage more than $500 billion apiece. The divergence is even more surprising given FTEC\u2019s cheaper price tag: XLK charges 13 basis points and VGT charges 10 basis points. The lack of popularity isn\u2019t due to any particular defect of FTEC ; rather, it\u2019s largely due to a dearth of marketing by Fidelity, which has a long-standing arrangement with BlackRock\u2019s iShares funds, which are offered commission free on Fidelity\u2019s platform.

GSLC\u2019s 2015 debut made a splash by charging an ultra-low management fee. At just 9 basis points, it was significantly cheaper than the smart-beta competition, and exactly the same price as the plain-vanilla SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( SPY ), the first and largest ETF on the market.

The investment thesis behind a small cap investment is the growth factor that comes along with these securities. While mega-cap firms have already hit their peak, smaller companies may be the next juggernaut. The downside to small-cap investing is additional risk. Changes in regulation, credit availability, or product viability could send share prices plummeting. While some exposure to these small companies is healthy for a portfolio, the allocation should be kept relatively low since this market segment experiences extreme volatility. Investors in total-market ETFs already have some allocation to small-caps and should make sure that they\u2019re not unintentionally overweighting a risky space. Conversely, investors with strong convictions about small-caps might want to augment a total market fund with SPSM to boost their exposure. Like all of State Streets\u2019s SPDR Portfolio lineup, SPSM is priced to match or beat rivals like the iShares Core S&P Small Cap ETF ( IJR ). SPSM has changed its underlying index a couple of times in recent years, but as of January 2020 it tracks the same S&P SmallCap 600 index as IJR and at a lower fee, making it an appealing option for longer-term investors who are looking for growth and aware of the risks that come with small-cap stocks. SPSM still lags IJR in assets though and some short-term traders might prefer IJR\u2019s size and liquidity.

This fund is competitive from a cost perspective and offers up unmatched liquidity, making it worthy of consideration for any investors seeking exposure to this corner of the bond market. While TIPS have become popular as a means of protecting against inflation, it is noted that there are potential limitations to this asset class in accomplishing this objective as well. TIP is by no means a surefire defense against inflation; rising interest rates, which tend to accompany upticks in CPI , have the potential to erode the value of this fund.

As such, the payments made by the underlying securities will fluctuate along with prevailing market interest rates.

There are a number of potential uses for FLOT . This fund can be used as a tactical allocation in environments where interest rates are expected to rise, shielding investors from interest rate increases.

This fund is unique from other EAFE ETFs such as EFA and VEA because it hedges out the currency exposure that an investment in international equities entails. In addition to establishing a long position in international stocks, investors using most EAFE ETFs are also going long the currencies of the underlying stocks (including the euro, yen, Aussie dollar, and pound sterling) and short the U.S. dollar. DBEF uses short term forward contracts to neutralize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, essentially isolating the performance of the developed market stocks as the driver of returns. While this difference may seem minor, the impact of currency movements on equities can be significant sources of return\u2014both positive and negative\u2014to U.S. based investors. Though DBEF\u2019s portfolio is nearly identical to those of VEA and EFA , the risk/return profiles of these products can vary significantly. Investors who expect the U.S. dollar to strengthen relative to its developed market rivals may prefer DBEF as the optimal means of establishing exposure to the EAFE region, as this fund should outperform EFA when the U.S. currency appreciates. Those with a bearish outlook for the greenback may prefer to leave currency exposure unhedged, utilizing a fund such as EFA instead. Those investors without a strong view in either direction might use a mix of both hedged and unhedged EAFE ETFs (eg 50% in DBEF and 50% in EFA ). Given the broad focus of this ETF , DBEF might be very useful to those building a long-term portfolio; the EAFE region generally receives a big weighting in most portfolios. DBEF can also be useful for establishing a currency-neutral tactical tilt towards this corner of the global equity market. Note that WisdomTree\u2019s HEDJ also delivers currency hedged exposure to ex-U.S. developed markets; that ETF is linked to a dividend-weighted index, and as such might be appealing to those looking to steer clear of cap-weighted products."}, {"symbol": "IJJ", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$140.01", "average_volume": "140,719", "name": "iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/IJJ/", "one_year_return": "6.40%", "description": "Explore IJJ for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "VDE", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$146.58", "average_volume": "657,195", "name": "Vanguard Energy ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/VDE/", "one_year_return": "16.41%", "description": "Explore VDE for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "BUFR", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$34.24", "average_volume": "1,183,743", "name": "FT Vest Laddered Buffer ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/BUFR/", "one_year_return": "-0.06%", "description": "Explore BUFR for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "IGM", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$121.62", "average_volume": "822,668", "name": "iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/IGM/", "one_year_return": "-5.84%", "description": "Explore IGM for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "FTCS", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$98.05", "average_volume": "480,417", "name": "First Trust Capital Strength ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FTCS/", "one_year_return": "5.99%", "description": "Explore FTCS for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "JGRO", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$87.45", "average_volume": "474,719", "name": "JPMorgan Active Growth ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/JGRO/", "one_year_return": "-5.77%", "description": "Explore JGRO for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DFAE", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$34.77", "average_volume": "821,854", "name": "Dimensional Emerging Core Equity Market ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DFAE/", "one_year_return": "6.75%", "description": "Explore DFAE for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "QYLD", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$17.33", "average_volume": "6,584,843", "name": "Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/QYLD/", "one_year_return": "-0.95%", "description": "The Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF ( QYLD ) follows a \u201ccovered call\u201d strategy in which the ETF buys the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index, then sells corresponding call options to generate a little extra income for investors.

"https://etfdb.com/etf/GUNR/", "one_year_return": "10.47%", "description": "This ETF is one of the more unique products in the Commodity Producers Equities ETFdb Category; GUNR focuses on the \u201cupstream\u201d portion of the natural resources supply chain, maintaining meaningful exposure to the water and timber industries along with positions in companies engaged in energy production, metals extraction, and agriculture. While this focus of GUNR might seem unique, this product consists of many well known stocks that are also found in other commodity-related products. GUNR is tilted heavily towards mega cap stocks, including Big Oil and major mining furms. Products such as GUNR may have appeal as ways to establish \u201cindirect\u201d exposure to commodity prices. Because the profitability of the component stocks tends to move in unison with spot prices of the underlying resources, this fund should perform well when natural resource prices are on the rise. GUNR can be used in a number of different ways; those looking to maintain a tilt towards commodity intensive equities might find this fund to be a valuable addition to a long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio. It can also be an effective way to establish more tactical, short-term exposure to the commodity industry. The GUNR portfolio consists of a number of names that are probably widely recognized by most investors, including mega cap energy and mining firms. With more than 100 individual components, GUNR offers relatively deep exposure to the global commodity sector; it also achieves impressive balance, spreading holdings relatively evenly across the basket of stocks. In terms of expenses, GUNR is towards the low end for this corner of the ETF market. For investors seeking more targeted exposure to commodity-intensive equities, there are a number of options in the Commodity Producers Equities ETFdb Category that focus on specific natural resources (such as timber, mining, or agriculture). There are also several choices for more broad-based exposure; ETFs such as HAP will have considerable overlap with GUNR ."}, {"symbol": "URTH", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$186.46", "average_volume": "473,186", "name": "iShares MSCI World ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/URTH/", "one_year_return": "0.37%", "description": "Explore URTH for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DFSV", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$36.17", "average_volume": "1,130,286", "name": "Dimensional US Small Cap Value ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DFSV/", "one_year_return": "9.97%", "description": "Explore DFSV for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "JMUB", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$50.87", "average_volume": "780,067", "name": "JPMorgan Municipal ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/JMUB/", "one_year_return": "1.01%", "description": "Explore JMUB for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "SPMB", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$22.51", "average_volume": "794,829", "name": "State Street SPDR Portfolio Mortgage Backed Bond ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SPMB/", "one_year_return": "0.73%", "description": "Explore SPMB for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "XLB", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$50.50", "average_volume": "14,525,543", "name": "State Street Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/XLB/", "one_year_return": "11.36%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "GRID", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$165.77", "average_volume": "373,497", "name": "First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Smart GRID Infrastructure Index", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/GRID/", "one_year_return": "8.33%", "description": "Explore GRID for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "IJT", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$148.44", "average_volume": "114,275", "name": "iShares S&P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/IJT/", "one_year_return": "5.16%", "description": "Explore IJT for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "JMBS", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$45.80", "average_volume": "897,771", "name": "Janus Henderson Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/JMBS/", "one_year_return": "0.69%", "description": "Explore JMBS for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "FELC", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$37.86", "average_volume": "928,924", "name": "Fidelity Enhanced Large Cap Core ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FELC/", "one_year_return": "-0.81%", "description": "Explore FELC for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "FPE", "asset_class": "Preferred Stock", "price": "$18.27", "average_volume": "1,517,673", "name": "First Trust Preferred Securities & Income ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FPE/", "one_year_return": "0.63%", "description": "Explore FPE for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "TFLO", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$50.51", "average_volume": "1,391,068", "name": "iShares Treasury Floating Rate Bond ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/TFLO/", "one_year_return": "0.39%", "description": "Explore TFLO for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "FXI", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$38.20", "average_volume": "31,050,277", "name": "iShares China Large-Cap ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FXI/", "one_year_return": "-0.24%", "description": "Explore FXI for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DIVO", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$46.29", "average_volume": "831,609", "name": "Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DIVO/", "one_year_return": "4.44%", "description": "Explore DIVO for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "TCAF", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$37.02", "average_volume": "1,014,522", "name": "T.

At one point, the fund made an exceptionally well-timed investment in Bitcoin, which turbocharged its performance.

The ETF invests in Treasuries with a remaining maturity of one to three years. The ETF provides minimal credit risk and low interest-rate risk.

This ETF becomes particularly useful for investors looking to enhance current returns but concerned about the impact of rising interest rates on bond valuations. The focus on lower quality bonds delivers a significant amount of credit risk (and, therefore, the associated returns) while the focus on the short end of the maturity spectrum limits the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Most of the other ETFs in the High Yield Bonds ETFdb Category focus on longer-term debt, and as such may be more sensitive to changes in interest rate risk.

ANGL is unique from many other products in the High Yield Bonds ETFdb Category in that it focuses exclusively on debt that was rated as investment grade at time of issuance but has since been downgraded to junk status. Given that objective, ANGL will tend to be concentrated at the higher end of the credit quality spectrum, and may hold bonds that are more likely to be upgraded back to investment grade status (which would generally involve a jump in price). This ETF is a bit more expensive than some of the competing junk bond ETFs out there, but still very cheap given the investment objective."}, {"symbol": "VAW", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$229.55", "average_volume": "83,019", "name": "Vanguard Materials ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/VAW/", "one_year_return": "10.60%", "description": "Explore VAW for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "USMC", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$66.67", "average_volume": "120,130", "name": "Principal U.S. Mega-Cap ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/USMC/", "one_year_return": "-2.60%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "FLIN", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$37.80", "average_volume": "750,770", "name": "Franklin FTSE India ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FLIN/", "one_year_return": "-2.05%", "description": "The Franklin FTSE India ETF ( FLIN ) tracks an index of large and mid-size companies in India.

The fund is part of a series of single-country ETFs that Franklin Templeton began rolling out in 2017. The funds debuted with significantly lower management fees than rival iShares funds, which have long dominated the single-country ETF space.

So for those concerned about increases in interest rates, FLRN can be a useful tool for minimizing interest rate risk while still deriving some yield. It should be noted that FLRN is unlikely to deliver substantial current returns to investors; because of the floating rate feature and the focus on investment grade debt, there is little in the way of credit risk or interest rate risk to require compensation. So this security should exhibit relatively low volatility; it can be a nice way to generate a little bit of yield, perhaps as a place to park cash in between allocations to riskier asset classes.

TDTT could be used, in moderate amounts, by buy-and-hold investors, or as a tactical play for those looking to shift into low-risk assets that may hold up well in inflationary environments.

screened for environmental, social and governance factors, known by the acronym ESG . SNPE excludes companies with disqualifying U.N. Global Compact scores, and those involved with tobacco or controversial weapons. The fund targets the 75% with the highest ESG scores within each industry group of the S&P 500. The portfolio holdings are market-cap weighted but adjusted to maintain broadly similar sector exposure to the parent index. SNPE is priced competitively. It owns just over 300 of the stocks in the S&P 500, and its top holdings look \u2014 by design \u2014 very similar to the plain-vanilla index. Some notable names are left out, including Johnson & Johnson and Berkshire Hathaway. Issuers have rolled out dozens of ESG -style funds in recent years to appeal to younger investors who are concerned about the social impact of their investments. ESG (the strategy, not the ticker) is different from traditional socially-responsible investing, which typically tried to exclude bad actors and industries. Many advisers worried that this came at the expense of diversification and returns. today\u2019s strategies aim to be more inclusive. Instead of ignoring large swathes of the market, the goal is maintain market-like diversification with a tilt toward the best corporate citizens. It\u2019s worth nothing that there are plenty of skeptics when it comes to ESG investing, and critics say ESG whitewashes a portfolio rather than driving companies to truly change their behavior. Investors who prefer plain-vanilla ETFs can take a look at funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ( VOO ) or the iShares S&P 500 ETF ( IVV )."}, {"symbol": "HDEF", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$32.72", "average_volume": "154,379", "name": "Xtrackers MSCI EAFE High Dividend Yield Equity ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/HDEF/", "one_year_return": "5.58%", "description": "The Xtrackers MSCI EAFE High Dividend Yield Equity ETF ( HDEF ) offers broad exposure to developed markets outside of the U.S. and Canada, but with a twist: it looks for stocks that pay high dividends compared to their price.

investing. The fund follows a Northern Trust index that selects dividend-paying large-cap U.S. equities. Simple enough, but then the index weights the portfolio toward companies that earned the highest \u201cdividend quality\u201d scores. To prevent unintentional concentrations, the methodology caps the weighting of individual securities, industry groups, sectors and styles. Lastly, the fund tries to deliver \u201cmarket-like beta\u201d \u2014 jargon used to describe how volatile the performance is relative to the market. It\u2019s another way of saying QDF tries to match market volatility. The approach to market beta is the nuance that sets it apart from its sister funds FlexShares Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund ( QDEF ) and FlexShares Quality Dividend Dynamic Index Fund ( QDYN ), which aim to reduce or exceed market swings, respectively. In practice, all three funds share many of the same top holdings, including blue-chip stocks like Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. The difference comes down to weighting. QDEF might have less invested in volatile tech stocks than QDYN , while QDF will be somewhere in the middle. As with many FlexShares funds, investors will pay a premium. Management fees, though not eye-popping for proprietary index strategies, are multiples higher than U.S. equity ETFs offered by massive passives like Vanguard and iShares. Is it worth it? Investors can look at it several different ways. There are plenty of other variations on dividend investing. There are traditional defensive mainstays like utility ETFs, such as the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ( XLU ). There are also the ultra-cheap dividend ETFs like the giant Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF ( VIG ) or the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF ( VYM ).

The advisory firm, led by Catherine Wood, has an impressive track record doing what most stock pickers fail to do: beating the market. The stated goal of ARKW is to invest in companies that are poised to profit from advances in cloud computing, e-commerce, big data, artificial intelligence, mobile technology, social platforms and financial technology. The fund\u2019s biggest holdings include familiar names like Tesla, Square, Amazon and Roku, as well as lesser-known firms like Splunk and 2U. ARKW\u2019s management fee of 76 basis points might seem pricey in the ultra-low-cost world of passive ETFs, but it\u2019s cheap for active management. It appears to be worth it. ARKW has returned nearly twice as much over the past five years as the First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index Fund ( SKYY ). SKYY isn\u2019t all that cheap either, charging 60 basis points for a fund that simply tracks an index, and lags behind ARKW\u2019s performance to boot. For skeptics worried ARK has been lucky rather than good, ARK\u2019s flagship Innovation ETF ( ARKK ) has routinely outperformed passive rivals like State Street\u2019s popular index-tracking Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLK ). But ARK is known for high-conviction bets, and the firm has come under fire for its outsized wager on Tesla. Any actively-managed product is ultimately a wager on the portfolio managers who pick the stocks. ARK\u2019s products are geared toward investors who have the fortitude and faith to ride out short-term blips in favor of long-term gains. ARKW is an interesting choice for investors who believe in the long-term prospects of the internet of things, and are willing to pay a slightly higher price for an active manager that might deliver an outsized payoff."}, {"symbol": "PKW", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$136.88", "average_volume": "31,965", "name": "Invesco BuyBack Achievers\u2122 ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/PKW/", "one_year_return": "1.91%", "description": "Explore PKW for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "RWR", "asset_class": "Real Estate", "price": "$102.44", "average_volume": "331,405", "name": "State Street SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/RWR/", "one_year_return": "4.29%", "description": "Explore RWR for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "HYS", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$94.30", "average_volume": "132,163", "name": "PIMCO 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond Index Exchange-Traded Fund", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/HYS/", "one_year_return": "0.08%", "description": "This ETF is one of several products that offers exposure to junk bonds, an asset class that has historically exhibited equity like returns with relatively low volatility. Because most broad-based bond ETFs focus only on the investment grade side of the market, funds such as HYS can be useful for rounding out the fixed income side of a long-term portfolio. This ETF could also be appealing to those looking to establish a shorter-term tactical tilt towards high yield debt. Unlike other products in the High Yield Bonds ETFdb Category such as JNK or HYG , this ETF focuses on short-term debt. That focus may be appealing for investors concerned about rising interest rates; the lower the effective duration, the lower the impact of rate changes on the value of the related fixed income securities. The elimination of some interest rate risk may translate into a reduction of yields as well; HYS may exhibit return metrics that are lower than other more broadly-based funds. For investors looking to beef up current returns but concerned about the impact of rising rates, this ETF might be a useeful tool for fine tuning fixed income exposure. This ETF is among the more expensive choices for high yield debt exposure, though the deltas in expense ratios are relatively small throughout this ETFdb Category. Investors seeking to fine tune exposure and capture a yield experience more similar to an individual bond may like the BulletShares products from Guggenheim, while those who would prefer to achieve junk bond exposure through an experienced manager might like HYLD ."}, {"symbol": "VIOV", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$106.45", "average_volume": "45,852", "name": "Vanguard S&P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/VIOV/", "one_year_return": "8.89%", "description": "Explore VIOV for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "EMOP", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$44.55", "average_volume": "18,435", "name": "AB Emerging Markets Opportunities ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/EMOP/", "one_year_return": "9.42%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "ILOW", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$43.53", "average_volume": "87,446", "name": "AB International Low Volatility Equity ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/ILOW/", "one_year_return": "2.22%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "JPIB", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$48.99", "average_volume": "244,302", "name": "JPMorgan International Bond Opportunities ETF of Benef Interest", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/JPIB/", "one_year_return": "1.00%", "description": "Explore JPIB for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "VTC", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$77.83", "average_volume": "116,890", "name": "Vanguard Total Corporate Bond ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/VTC/", "one_year_return": "0.66%", "description": "Explore VTC for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "TNA", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$50.21", "average_volume": "11,039,563", "name": "Direxion Daily Small Cap Bull 3X Shares", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/TNA/", "one_year_return": "10.25%", "description": "Explore TNA for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "BWX", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$22.64", "average_volume": "761,889", "name": "SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/BWX/", "one_year_return": "0.64%", "description": "Explore BWX for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "AVIG", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$41.98", "average_volume": "206,932", "name": "Avantis Core Fixed Income ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/AVIG/", "one_year_return": "0.14%", "description": "AVIG invests in a broad set of debt obligations across sectors, maturities and issuers.

The notes are intended to be used as short-term trading tools by sophisticated investors. FNGU , like most leveraged products, rebalances at the end of every trading day. In practice, this means FNGU\u2019s performance will diverge significantly from the underlying stocks. The daily reset means that FNGU could lose money over time even if the underlying equities have posted a gain, which can come as a rude surprise to buy-and-hold investors.

Investors building a long-term portfolio may find more broad-based EAFE ETFs such as EFA or VEA to be more efficient from a cost perspective. Like many international equity ETFs, EWA is dominated by large cap stocks, which introduces certain biases into the portfolio.

The fund is also unique in that it maintains equal allocations to each of ten sectors; that makes it very different from many dividend-focused products, which tend to have biases towards utilities and financials. The portfolio also consists of equal weighting to each individual component stocks, which might be appealing to those who favor equal weight strategies. SDOG can be a useful tool for achieving a diverse portfolio of large cap U.S. stocks while also seeking to capture a meaningful dividend yield. SDOG will generally maintain a dividend yield that is much greater than the S&P 500, and will often exceed many other dividend-focused ETFs as well. One potential caveat is the possibility of falling into \u201cvalue trap\u201d stocks that have high yields that result from deteriorating business models and depressed stock prices.

SDIV can be used in a variety of different ways within a portfolio; it may have appeal as a core holding as part of a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy that emphasizes current return, and could also be useful for establishing a shorter-term tactical tilt towards a group of equities that offer attractive distributions and a unique risk/return profile. SDIV is also unique in the weighting methodology employed. While many dividend ETFs use a dividend-weighted or cap-weighted methodology, SDIV is linked to an equal-weighted index. That approach has several potential benefits: it breaks the link between stock price and allocation (a common criticism of cap-weighted funds) and avoids concentration of holdings in a small number of holdings. The equal-weighting approach will also force a disciplined rebalancing of holdings, taking gains from stocks that have performed well recently and moving them into names that have lagged behind. For investors looking to establish exposure to a dividend-focused fund, SDIV is one of several good options. It makes sense to compare the yields of the potential options, as well as the geographic allocation and the balance of holdings ( SDIV will be hard to beat on that front).

Stocks are screened out based on liquidity, and the index then targets the largest 70% of companies from each eligible country. BKIE is priced competitively with ultra-low-cost rivals like the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF ( IEFA ), the SPDR Portfolio Developed World ex-US ETF ( SPDW ), the Charles Schwab\u2019s International Equity ETF ( SCHF ), and the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF ( VEA ). As a result of its methodology, BKIE owns a far smaller universe of securities than those funds, and tilts more heavily toward large cap stocks. Another important consideration is that BKIE excludes South Korea but includes Canada. By contrast, IEFA excludes both Canada and South Korea, lumping South Korea into emerging markets. Meanwhile, VEA , SPDW , and SCHF include both Canada and South Korea. Unsuspecting investors who mix and match funds from different firms may find themselves either unintentionally overweight Canada and South Korea, or missing out on those countries entirely.

Given this investment objective, PPH is probably more useful for those looking to achieve tactical exposure to this specific corner of the market; the appeal to buy-and-holders will be limited since many of the components are included in more broad-based funds. A couple aspects of PPH are noteworthy. First, though PPH is now structured as a true ETF , it used to be one of the HOLDRS products offered by Merrill Lynch. Some of the concentration that was characteristic of those products remains in PPH ; the portfolio is relatively shallow and concentration in the top allocations is significant. Further, PPH includes only U.S. stocks, meaning that some of the biggest players in the pharmaceutical industry are excluded from the underlying portfolio. PPH is a decent option for pharma exposure, but there are probably some better ETFs out there for tapping into this segment of the market.

The fund follows a Northern Trust index that selects dividend-paying companies in developed and emerging markets outside the U.S. Simple enough, but then the index weights the portfolio toward companies that earned the highest \u201cdividend quality\u201d scores. To prevent unintentional concentrations, the methodology caps the weighting of individual securities, industry groups, sectors and regions. Lastly, the fund aims to match market beta \u2014 jargon used to describe how volatile performance is relative to the market. It\u2019s another way of saying IQDF aims to be no more or less risky than the market. Investors can be excused for confusing IQDF with its sister funds: The FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic Index Fund ( IQDY ) and the FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund ( IQDE ). Like FlexShares\u2019 domestic variations on the same theme, the three funds are distinguished by their approach to market beta. IQDY aims for a little more risk than the market, IQDE for a little less, and IQDF tries to match it. In practice, all three funds share many of the same top holdings, including Royal Bank of Canada, GlaxoSmithKline and L\u2019Oreal. The difference comes down to weighting, with IQDY leaning a little more on volatile tech stocks than IQDE and IQDF . Many FlexShares funds charge a premium for the Northern Trust expertise, but the FlexShares international dividend ETFs are priced competitively. Still, they are multiples more expensive than plain-vanilla international equity ETFs. Is it worth it? Investors can look at it several different ways. There are other international factor strategies out there, like the Vident International Equity Fund ( VIDI ) or the highly-concentrated (and extremely expensive) First Trust Dorsey Wright International Focus 5 ETF . There are plenty of other international dividend ETFs like the WisdomTree Global ex-U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund ( DNL ), the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF ( DWX ), or the iShares International Select Dividend ETF ( IDV ).

(Bond prices typically fall when interest rates rise.) Investors who want to hedge against inflation and changing interest rates might consider short-term TIPS ETFs such as the iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond ETF ( STIP ) or the PIMCO 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS Index ETF ( STPZ ).

GSSC tracks a proprietary index that takes a multi-factor approach, looking for stocks that exhibit good value, strong momentum, high quality, and low volatility. Top holdings include Trex, Deckers Outdoor and Boston Beer Company. The case for investing in small companies is the growth potential compared to mega-cap stocks that may have already hit their peak. The downside is that small companies also come with a fair amount of risk. Changes in regulations, economic circumstances, or access to credit could send share prices tumbling. While some exposure to small companies is standard for many portfolios, investors should avoid the risk of leaning too heavily on a notably volatile segment. GSSC is reasonably priced for a multi-factor ETF , though more expensive than the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF ( IJR ), the plain-vanilla index ETF that is among the biggest in the small-cap segment. There are other differences besides cost. GSSC owns more than twice as many stocks as IJR . It also has a smaller slice of its portfolio invested in micro-cap stocks.

Emerging market debt generally offers higher interest rates than debt of U.S. issuers, making this fund potentially appealing to those looking to boost the amount of current income derived from their portfolios. LEMB can be used to complement positions in U.S. debt generally achieved through funds such as AGG or BND , allowing investors to diversify their debt holdings geographically. It should be noted that the Emerging Markets Bonds ETFdb Category includes both products that invest in dollar denominated debt securities and those that invest in bonds denominated in the local currency of the issuer. LEMB falls into the latter category; because the debt is issued in emerging markets currencies, this product includes exchange rate risk. A strengthening dollar will hurt LEMB\u2019s returns, while a decline in the greenback will help this fund; those looking for dollar diversification can achieve it through LEMB (or through funds such as ELD or EMLC ). Those looking to avoid fluctuations caused by changes in the exchange rate might prefer EMB , which holds dollar-denominated debt. Alternative ETFs offering similar exposure include the actively-managed ELD and EMLC from Van Eck; both of those products are a bit cheaper than this fund."}, {"symbol": "NUKZ", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$66.79", "average_volume": "151,181", "name": "Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/NUKZ/", "one_year_return": "5.18%", "description": "Explore NUKZ for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "IETC", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$90.18", "average_volume": "63,343", "name": " iShares U.S. Tech Independence Focused ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/IETC/", "one_year_return": "-11.23%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "FXU", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$46.84", "average_volume": "823,686", "name": "First Trust Utilities AlphaDEX Fund", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FXU/", "one_year_return": "4.07%", "description": "Explore FXU for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "AUSF", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$49.02", "average_volume": "52,054", "name": "Global X Adaptive U.S. Factor ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/AUSF/", "one_year_return": "6.38%", "description": "Explore AUSF for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DJP", "asset_class": "Commodity", "price": "$40.69", "average_volume": "90,110", "name": "iPath Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return ETN", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DJP/", "one_year_return": "8.19%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "OUSA", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$59.28", "average_volume": "32,592", "name": "ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/OUSA/", "one_year_return": "2.88%", "description": "Explore OUSA for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "FDD", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$18.24", "average_volume": "266,333", "name": "First Trust STOXX European Select Dividend Index Fund", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FDD/", "one_year_return": "4.20%", "description": "Explore FDD for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DSPY", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$58.76", "average_volume": "2,286", "name": "Tema S&P 500 Historical Weight ETF Strategy", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DSPY/", "one_year_return": "0.79%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "EIS", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$118.77", "average_volume": "95,252", "name": "iShares MSCI Israel ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/EIS/", "one_year_return": "7.94%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "VFVA", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$141.06", "average_volume": "11,919", "name": "Vanguard U.S. Value Factor ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/VFVA/", "one_year_return": "6.24%", "description": "Explore VFVA for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "ABFL", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$71.04", "average_volume": "44,398", "name": "Abacus FCF Leaders ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/ABFL/", "one_year_return": "-0.46%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "BSJR", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$22.59", "average_volume": "206,056", "name": "Invesco BulletShares 2027 High Yield Corporate Bond ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/BSJR/", "one_year_return": "0.37%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "SPEU", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$54.03", "average_volume": "60,108", "name": "State Street SPDR Portfolio Europe ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SPEU/", "one_year_return": "3.65%", "description": "The SPDR Portfolio Europe ETF ( SPEU ) tracks an index of European stocks, and does it for an extremely competitive price.

In the second strategy, the team uses factors like quality, momentum, and value in determining whether to hold long or short positions in individual stocks and stock indices. The fund is reasonably priced for what it offers but offers little liquidity and often trades at wide spreads. Ultimately any actively managed fund is a bet on the manager\u2019s ability to outperform the market. FLSP is reasonably priced for what it offers but is not a tool for buy-and-hold investors who want low-cost, diversified asset allocation. There are other hedge-fund imitators in the ETF marketplace. Given the consistent under-performance of active management, investors might wonder if there\u2019s any point in trying to mimic them, but that hasn\u2019t stopped issuers from trying.

This product is unique from many ETFs in the Japan Equities ETFdb Category in that DBJP hedges out the currency exposure that an investment in international equities brings. This essentially delivers isolated exposure to the performance of the underlying equities in local prices. The impact of currency appreciation or depreciation can be significant in many cases, especially considering the sometimes meaningful swings in the JPY / USD exchange rate. Though EWJ and DBJP maintain substantially identical portfolios, the risk/return profiles of these ETFs may vary significantly. Investors who expect the U.S. dollar to appreciate relative to the yen might prefer this fund as a way to bet on the performance of Japanese stocks; DBJP should outperform EWJ when the U.S. currency strengthens. Those expecting the dollar to lose value relative to its Japanese rival will probably prefer to leave currency exposure unhedged, utilizing a fund such as EWJ instead. Those investors without a strong view in either direction might use a mix of both hedged and unhedged Japan equity ETFs (e.g., 50% DBJP and 50% EWJ ). Given the relatively narrow country-specific focus of this ETF , DBJP may be most useful to those looking to establish a tactical tilt towards Japan or implementing a country rotation strategy. The more broad-based DBEF includes exposure to Japanese stocks as well as other ex-U.S. international equities, as do a handful of other EAFE ETFs. Those looking for exposure to Japanese stocks that steers clear of currency risk also have DXJ to consider; that WisdomTree ETF employs a similar strategy to eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, and is linked to a dividend-weighted index that will impact the shape of the underlying portfolio."}, {"symbol": "HCMT", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$36.73", "average_volume": "64,544", "name": "Direxion HCM Tactical Enhanced US ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/HCMT/", "one_year_return": "-4.75%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "PSFF", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$32.30", "average_volume": "73,384", "name": "Pacer Swan SOS Fund of Funds ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/PSFF/", "one_year_return": "-0.10%", "description": "Explore PSFF for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "ONEV", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$140.02", "average_volume": "11,646", "name": "State Street SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/ONEV/", "one_year_return": "5.14%", "description": "Explore ONEV for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "SSUS", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$48.39", "average_volume": "28,467", "name": "Strategy Shares Day Hagan Smart Sector ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SSUS/", "one_year_return": "-0.74%", "description": "Explore SSUS for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "SFY", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$128.78", "average_volume": "20,767", "name": "SoFi Select 500 ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SFY/", "one_year_return": "-2.56%", "description": "Explore SFY for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "FYLD", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$35.78", "average_volume": "51,038", "name": "Cambria Foreign Shareholder Yield ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FYLD/", "one_year_return": "10.13%", "description": "Explore FYLD for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "VFMF", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$160.29", "average_volume": "17,792", "name": "Vanguard U.S. Multifactor ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/VFMF/", "one_year_return": "6.35%", "description": "Explore VFMF for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "NVDU", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$98.50", "average_volume": "614,208", "name": "Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2X Shares", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/NVDU/", "one_year_return": "-16.33%", "description": "Explore NVDU for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "TOTR", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$40.83", "average_volume": "5,817", "name": "T.

companies \u201cthat demonstrate just business behavior.\u201d The methodology scores companies on issues such as customer privacy, diversity, inclusion, gender diversity and greenhouse gas emissions. The portfolio invests in those companies with above-average scores. JUST is a hybrid creature in the world of socially-responsible investing. On the one hand, it fits into the legacy values-investing segment by providing a liberal alternative to funds that avoid so-called \u201csin stocks.\u201d JUST\u2019s focus on inclusion and diversity is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Inspire 100 ETF ( BIBL ), which has been criticized for enshrining bigotry by deliberately excluding companies that engage in the \u201cpromotion or acceptance of the LGBT lifestyle.\u201d JUST also appeals to investors interested in the growing ESG segment of the fund market, where companies are rated and weighted based on environmental, social and governance factors. ESG (the strategy, not the ticker) is different from traditional socially-responsible investing, which typically tried to exclude bad actors and industries. Many advisers worried that this came at the expense of diversification and returns. Today\u2019s ESG strategies aim to be more inclusive. Instead of ignoring large swathes of the market, the goal is to maintain market-like diversification with a tilt toward the best corporate citizens. It\u2019s worth nothing that there are plenty of skeptics when it comes to ESG investing, and critics say ESG whitewashes a portfolio rather than driving companies to truly change their behavior. Issuers have rolled out dozens of ESG -style funds in recent years to appeal to younger investors who are concerned about the social impact of their investments, so JUST has plenty of competition. For cost conscious investors, there are inexpensive ESG options such as the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF ( ESGV ) and the iShares ESG MSCI U.S.A. ETF ( ESGU )."}, {"symbol": "QINT", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$67.17", "average_volume": "41,724", "name": "American Century Quality Diversified International ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/QINT/", "one_year_return": "4.61%", "description": "Explore QINT for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "QDEF", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$82.38", "average_volume": "12,773", "name": "FlexShares Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/QDEF/", "one_year_return": "1.75%", "description": "The FlexShares Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund ( QDEF ) is part of Northern Trust\u2019s stable of proprietary twists on factor investing. The fund follows a Northern Trust index that selects dividend-paying large-cap U.S. equities. Simple enough, but then the index weights the portfolio toward companies that earned the highest \u201cdividend quality\u201d scores. To prevent unintentional concentrations, the methodology caps the weighting of individual securities, industry groups, sectors and styles. Lastly, there\u2019s the \u201cdefensive\u201d spin. QDEF aims to deliver \u201cbelow market beta exposure\u201d \u2014 jargon used to describe how volatile the performance is relative to the market. It\u2019s another way of saying QDEF tries to tamp down volatility. The approach to market beta is the nuance that sets it apart from its sister funds FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund ( QDF ) and FlexShares Quality Dividend Dynamic Index Fund ( QDYN ), which aim to match or exceed market swings, respectively. In practice, all three funds share many of the same top holdings, including blue-chip stocks like Apple, Johnson & Johnson, and Microsoft. The difference comes down to weighting. QDEF might have less invested in volatile tech stocks, and more in staid utilities. As with many FlexShares funds, investors will pay a premium. Management fees, though not eye-popping for proprietary index strategies, are multiples higher than U.S. equity ETFs offered by massive passives like Vanguard and iShares. Is it worth it? Investors can look at it several different ways. There are other factor variations on defensive dividend investing, such as the WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund ( DGRW ) or the Legg Mason Low Volatility High Dividend ETF ( LVHD ). Both share a roughly similar investment case with QDEF . Each uses its own proprietary index recipes, which results in noticeably different portfolios. (Both are also cheaper than QDEF .) There are also straightforward quality-focused funds, like the relatively inexpensive iShares Edge MSCI U.S.A. Quality Factor ETF ( QUAL ), which shares a number of top holdings with QDEF . There are other proprietary defensive strategies, like the Invesco Defensive Equity ETF ( DEF ), as well as the traditional mainstays of defensive investing: utility ETFs like the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ( XLU ). Lastly, there are the ultra-cheap dividend ETFs like the giant Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF ( VIG ) or the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF ( VYM ).

Combining this volatility with explicit leverage results in a fund that has the potential to churn out big gains or losses, meaning that KOLD is really only appropriate for sophisticated, active investors. It is important to understand exactly what KOLD offers; this product seeks to deliver leveraged returns not on spot natural gas prices but rather amplified returns on an index comprised of natural gas futures contracts. Depending on the slope of the futures curve, returns delivered by futures-based funds can vary significantly from hypothetical gains on an investment in spot (for obvious reasons, an investment in spot natural gas is not realistic for most investors). It is also important to note that BOIL maintains a daily reset feature, which means that this position should be monitored carefully if kept open for multiple trading sessions. KOLD does not belong in a long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio, and should generally be avoided by anyone without a thorough understanding of leveraged ETFs and natural gas futures markets. For those looking to make a short term bet against natural gas prices, however, KOLD can be a very powerful tool. Expect this fund to see increases in volatility and trading volume on Thursdays around the release of the weekly natural gas storage report. ProShares also offers a 200% counterpart, BOIL , which is linked to the same underlying index but designed to perform well when natural gas futures prices rise. For investors seeking traditional non-leveraged, long exposure to natural gas futures, there are a number of options, including UNG , UNL , NAGS , and GAZ .

The daily reset means that DFEN could lose money over time even if the underlying equities have posted a gain, which can come as a rude surprise to buy-and-hold investors who don\u2019t read the fine print. DFEN is ideal for traders looking for a way to place an ultra-short-term high-conviction wager on a rally in defense industry stocks.

For longer-term investors who want passive exposure to defense stocks without the complications of leverage, BlackRock\u2019s iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ( ITA ) tracks the same underlying index as DFEN , and State Street\u2019s SPDR S&P Aerospace and Defense ETF ( XAR ) tracks an MSCI index and invests in many of the same companies.

"iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Small-Cap ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/EEMS/", "one_year_return": "5.79%", "description": "This ETF offers exposure to small cap stocks in emerging markets, an asset class that is often overlooked by investors but that should be included in most buy-and-hold portfolios. In addition to being a very useful tool for investors with a long-term time horizon, EEMS can be appealing to more active traders as well; this ETF offers a way to achieve quick exposure to risky assets that often exhibit relatively high volatility in both directions. The most popular emerging markets ETFs, including EEM and VWO , are dominated by large cap stocks. While these funds offer exposure to the largest companies in the developing world, they may be impacted more significantly by broader macroeconomic trends than changes in local consumption. Small cap emerging markets companies may offer better \u201cpure plays\u201d on the local economies, and may also provide exposure to sectors that are underrepresented in large cap-heavy funds (which tend to be tilted toward energy and financials). Given its objective, EEMS can be useful as either an alternative or complement to products such as EEM or VWO ; those seeking to achieve well rounded emerging markets exposure can do so by combining positions in large cap and small cap funds. The EEMS portfolio is both broad and deep; the concentration issues that can pop up in large cap funds are not present, and this fund is relatively well balanced from a sector perspective as well. EEMS is more expensive than many other emerging markets ETFs, but the fees charged are reasonable given the type of exposure offered (though EWX offers a way to improve cost efficiency).

Unlike more traditional REITs, mortgage REITs don\u2019t actually own real estate. Instead, these entities generate revenue through real estate financing by issuing mortgages or acquiring loans and mortgage-backed securities. The streams of revenue generated from these operations can often be substantial, making MORT a potentially attractive tool for investors seeking to enhance the current returns generated from their portfolios. As such, this ETF has the potential to be useful as a yield enhancement tool in a long-term portfolio, and it can certainly also be useful in shorter-term strategies as well. It should be noted, however, that MORT is capable of significant volatility; because many of the underlying entities utilize leverage in their operations, this ETF can be fairly sensitive to interest rate changes and the overall health of the U.S. real estate market. Investors considering a position should take a look at the underlying portfolio in order to determine the extent to which leverage is used (Van Eck provides this information on its web site). The MORT portfolio is somewhat concentrated; the number of holdings is relatively shallow, and a small handful of components makes up a significant portion of total assets. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that component companies generally have exposure to thousands of individual mortgages or other real estate-related securities, potentially lessening the importance of balance in this corner of the markets. For investors looking to achieve attractive current returns and willing to take on a bit of risk to do so, MORT can be an intriguing destination.

The ETF focuses the majority of its assets on three sectors, financial services, consumer cyclical, and consumer defensive. Note that the heavy allocation to banks makes this fund especially volatile given the instability of Greek banks during the euro zone crisis. Another noteworthy allocation is the market cap breakdown of the product. GREK has no giant or even large cap holdings; instead, the fund diverts the majority of its assets to small and mid cap firms with some micro cap exposure.

Because BTAL maintains equal long and short dollar positions, its performance is independent of the overall market; rather, it depends on how certain sub-sets (or factors) of the U.S. equity market perform relative to one another. As such, these securities can be used in a number of different ways. Since they should exhibit very low correlations to both stock and bond markets, some may see BTAL as a tool for smoothing out portfolio volatility\u2014essentially a diversifying agent within traditional stock-and-bond portfolios. Others who believe the methodology has the potential to exploit market inefficiencies may see it as a means of generating alpha over both long and short time periods. Specifically, BTAL is designed to capture the spread return between high beta and low beta stocks; the portfolio maintains long positions in low beta stocks and short positions in high beta stocks. As such, BTAL can be generally expected to perform well when the market declines and to struggle when markets are climbing. This strategy is certainly nothing new; investors have been implementing strategies designed to capture the spreads between asset classes or sub-classes for decades. But the availability of this strategy within the ETF wrapper is a new innovation; it gives investors an opportunity to access a technique that may be time consuming and quite expensive if implemented individually through a single ticker symbol that brings all the efficiencies of ETFs. There are a couple interesting aspects of BTAL (and all QuantShares ETFs for that matter). The underlying portfolios are sector neutral, which ensures that the fund isn\u2019t simply long in sectors that traditionally exhibit low betas (such as utilities) and short sectors that have high betas (such as technology); rather, BTAL consists of both long and short positions in each sector of the market. Moreover, individual positions are equal weighted, which ensures that no one stock will dominate either the long or short positions in the portfolio. For investors who are seeking a low maintenance way to access this long/short strategy, BTAL could be an attractive option. This ETF could also be a useful tool for investors looking to bet on a market decline but unwilling to take on the significant risk that comes with a short-only strategy. BTAL should function as a tool to perform well in down markets, but with limited downside if stocks actually climb. The most significant drawback we see is the relatively high expense ratio. Because the underlying portfolio is market neutral, it would be reasonable to expect that long-term performance, before fees, should be close to zero. After taking out 80 basis points or so in expenses, that makes it likely that BTAL will lose money over the long haul, especially if markets trend upwards over the long run."}, {"symbol": "MSTU", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$3.65", "average_volume": "16,406,676", "name": "T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/MSTU/", "one_year_return": "-56.08%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "FPAG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$38.83", "average_volume": "41,781", "name": "FPA Global Equity ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FPAG/", "one_year_return": "4.66%", "description": "Explore FPAG for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "LRGG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$26.94", "average_volume": "40,944", "name": "Nomura Focused Large Growth ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/LRGG/", "one_year_return": "-8.99%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "KJAN", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$42.14", "average_volume": "59,195", "name": "Innovator U.S. Small Cap Power Buffer ETF -

Natural Gas", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/BOIL/", "one_year_return": "-0.22%", "description": "This ETF offers 2x daily leveraged exposure to natural gas, an asset class that is capable of delivering big swings in price over a relatively short period of time. Combining this volatility with explicit leverage results in a fund that has the potential to churn out big gains or losses, meaning that BOIL is really only appropriate for sophisticated, active investors. It is important to understand that BOIL seeks to deliver leveraged returns not on spot natural gas prices but rather amplified returns on an index comprised of natural gas futures contracts. Depending on the slope of the futures curve, returns delivered by futures-based funds can vary significantly from hypothetical gains on an investment in spot (for obvious reasons, an investment in spot natural gas is not realistic for most investors). It is also important to note that BOIL maintains a daily reset feature, which means that this position should be monitored carefully if kept open for multiple trading sessions. BOIL does not belong in a long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio, and should generally be avoided by anyone without a deep understanding of leveraged ETFs and natural gas futures markets. For those looking to make a short term bet on nat gas prices, however, BOIL can be a very powerful tool.

Given this targeted focus, XSW probably has limited appeal to investors looking to build a long-term portfolio; this ETF is likely more useful for those looking to establish a tactical overweight position to this corner of the market. There are a couple aspects of XSW that are noteworthy. First, this ETF is linked to an equal-weighted index, a feature that results in a balanced portfolio and lack of company-specific concentration. XSW is also very cheap considering the granularity of exposure offered; while there are cheaper broad-based funds in the Technology Equities ETFdb Category (such as XLK and FTQ ), this fund is a good bet for investors keeping an eye on fees.

INCO\u2019s appeal lies in the fact that this fund offers exposure to a corner of the Indian stock market that maintains tremendous long-term potential but is often overlooked by investors and receives relatively small allocations in broad India ETFs and ETNs. Ongoing urbanization and increases in levels of wealth and discretionary income stand to benefit India\u2019s consumer sector tremendously; a rising middle class will translate into greater expenditures on consumer goods and services. INCO focuses on this Indian consumer sector, positioning this fund to thrive as these trends play out. While the holdings are concentrated in this sector, it should be noted that INCO includes a number of different types of companies, such as car manufacturers, food and beverage companies, and hotel and leisure firms. The underlying portfolio is somewhat shallow, but relatively well balanced in order to provide an acceptable level of diversification. And while INCO is among the more expensive passive ETFs, the fees charged are reasonable considering the type of exposure offered.

Currency fluctuations can be a significant driver of gains and losses, and some investors may prefer the potential diversification benefit of exposure to non-U.S. dollar investments. DBAW offers similar exposure as the unhedged iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF ( IXUS ), but the currency hedges means the performance of the two will be substantially different. Investors who expect the U.S. dollar to appreciate relative to other currencies might prefer this fund as a way to bet on the performance of international stocks; DBAW should outperform IXUS when the U.S. currency strengthens. Those expecting the dollar to lose value relative to other currencies will probably prefer to leave currency exposure unhedged, utilizing a fund such as IXUS instead. Those investors without a strong view in either direction might use a mix of both hedged and unhedged equity ETFs (e.g., 50% DBAW and 50% IXUS ). The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI ACWI ex-U.S. ETF ( HAWX ) is similar to DBAW , though DBAW has more assets.

ETF ( GTIP ) tracks an index of treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS : bonds that feature a principal that adjusts based on certain measures of inflation. Goldman\u2019s particular twist is that it invests in \u201coff-the-run\u201d securities. The most-traded TIPS tend to be the newest issues, or \u201con-the-run\u201d securities. Other rules-based TIPS strategies buy only on-the-run TIPS , which may increase demand and drive up the price. Goldman helped develop an index designed to avoid any potential feeding frenzy by buying the less popular off-the-run TIPS . The fund invests in a broad mix of fixed-rate, U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign bonds that have a minimum issue size of $5 billion and at least one year to maturity. GTIP can be useful as a tool for investors who are particularly concerned about inflationary pressures. It\u2019s important to note that TIPS are not perfect hedges against inflation; there are some potential drawbacks to using products such as GTIP to hedge against a climb in CPI . But for those looking to use inflation-protected bonds in that capacity, GTIP offers broad TIPS exposure at a reasonable price. GTIP is a relative latecomer to a well-covered segment of the market, and it has yet to gather the assets of some of its seasoned rivals, like the iShares TIPS Bond ETF ( TIP ). There\u2019s plenty of other rivals to compare it to, including the Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF ( SCHP ), PIMCO Broad U.S. TIPS Index ETF ( TIPZ ) or the SPDR Portfolio TIPS ETF ( SPIP ). It\u2019s also worth noting that broad exposure to longer-dated TIPS may expose investors to longer duration, a measure of bonds\u2019 sensitivity to interest-rate moves. Investors who want to hedge against inflation and changing interest rates might consider short-term TIPS ETFs such as the iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond ETF ( STIP ) or the PIMCO 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS Index ETF ( STPZ )."}, {"symbol": "FBL", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$32.61", "average_volume": "1,863,295", "name": "GraniteShares 2x Long META Daily ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FBL/", "one_year_return": "0.31%", "description": "Explore FBL for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "FCTE", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$26.41", "average_volume": "47,883", "name": "SMI 3Fourteen Full-Cycle Trend ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FCTE/", "one_year_return": "6.06%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "GOAU", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$45.25", "average_volume": "45,963", "name": "US Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/GOAU/", "one_year_return": "6.32%", "description": "Explore GOAU for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "TBG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$36.05", "average_volume": "37,749", "name": "TBG Dividend Focus ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/TBG/", "one_year_return": "7.97%", "description": "Explore TBG for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "GDMA", "asset_class": "Multi-Asset", "price": "$40.95", "average_volume": "11,311", "name": "Gadsden Dynamic Multi-Asset ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/GDMA/", "one_year_return": "6.22%", "description": "Explore GDMA for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "ILDR", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$30.53", "average_volume": "73,383", "name": "First Trust Innovation Leaders ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/ILDR/", "one_year_return": "-7.46%", "description": "Explore ILDR for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DECW", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$33.89", "average_volume": "120,946", "name": "AllianzIM U.S. Equity Buffer20 Dec ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DECW/", "one_year_return": "-0.15%", "description": "Explore DECW for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "SVXY", "asset_class": "Volatility", "price": "$52.07", "average_volume": "2,103,355", "name": "ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SVXY/", "one_year_return": "-5.98%", "description": "This ETF offers inverse exposure to an index comprised of VIX futures contracts, making it an intriguing tool in certain environments.

When the VIX futures market is in a state of steep contango\u2014as it often has been historically\u2014 SVXY may offer exposure to a compelling strategy that can exploit structural inefficiencies. When the VIX market is backwardated, however, the strategy employed by this fund essentially has it flying into the wind, vulnerable to significant return erosion from the roll process. It should also be noted that SVXY maintains a daily reset feature; over multiple holding periods, this product will be impacted by the compounding of returns. SVXY can potentially be a very powerful tool, but is generally appropriate only for more sophisticated investors; those without an understanding of the VIX or futures-based strategies should steer clear. And this ETF doesn\u2019t belong in a long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio. The exposure offered by SVXY is generally similar to XIV , a popular product from VelocityShares. It should be noted, however, that the structures of these products differ; SVXY is an ETF , while XIV is an ETN . Both have potential advantages and drawbacks; SVXY avoids the credit risk that is inherent in any ETN , though XIV will not incur tracking error when rolling holdings."}, {"symbol": "HEEM", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$37.25", "average_volume": "22,533", "name": "iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Emerging Markets ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/HEEM/", "one_year_return": "7.17%", "description": "Explore HEEM for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "SMCX", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$11.72", "average_volume": "2,830,479", "name": "Defiance Daily Target 2X Long SMCI ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SMCX/", "one_year_return": "2.81%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "BVAL", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$28.91", "average_volume": "21,511", "name": "Bluemonte Large Cap Value ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/BVAL/", "one_year_return": "3.69%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "FNK", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$59.95", "average_volume": "6,505", "name": "First Trust Mid Cap Value AlphaDEX Fund", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FNK/", "one_year_return": "7.74%", "description": "Explore FNK for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "AQLT", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$28.89", "average_volume": "15,662", "name": "iShares MSCI Global Quality Factor ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/AQLT/", "one_year_return": "2.80%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "XTRE", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$49.78", "average_volume": "26,133", "name": "BondBloxx Bloomberg Three Year Target Duration US Treasury ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/XTRE/", "one_year_return": "0.37%", "description": "Explore XTRE for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "EWZS", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$14.73", "average_volume": "273,392", "name": "iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/EWZS/", "one_year_return": "13.92%", "description": "Explore EWZS for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "SMLV", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$142.07", "average_volume": "3,173", "name": "State Street SPDR US Small Cap Low Volatility Index ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SMLV/", "one_year_return": "8.35%", "description": "Explore SMLV for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "SELV", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$33.57", "average_volume": "23,963", "name": "SEI Enhanced Low Volatility U.S. Large Cap ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SELV/", "one_year_return": "3.90%", "description": "Explore SELV for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "FFOG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$42.72", "average_volume": "29,837", "name": "Franklin Focused Growth ETF FOCUSED GROWTH ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FFOG/", "one_year_return": "-8.70%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "IJUL", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$34.25", "average_volume": "25,560", "name": "Innovator International Developed Power Buffer ETF -

This ETF can be used in a number of different ways; it could have appeal as a tactical tool for establishing short term exposure to this segment of the bond market, and could also be useful as a longer-term core fixed income holding. Investors should note that some of the underlying CEFs employ leverage, which can lead to both enhanced returns and higher volatility. The primary drawback of XMPT is the hefty expense ratio.

IYLD is an ETF -of-ETFs, which means that the underlying securities are other exchange-traded products.

Like many exchange-traded commodity products, WEAT should not be expected to deliver exposure to spot wheat prices. Because the underlying index consists of wheat futures contracts, factors such as the slope of the futures curve and the current level of interest rates will impact the performance of WEAT . One distinguishing factor of WEAT \u2014and of all Teucrium agricultural products\u2014is the structure of the underlying holdings. Instead of concentrating holdings in front month futures, WEAT spreads futures contracts across multiple maturities. That is done with the objective of minimizing the impact of contango on bottom line returns. Given the targeted focus of WEAT , this product probably isn\u2019t of much use for those building a long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio. This product can, however, be useful for those looking to establish tactical exposure to a specific corner of the commodity market. For investors seeking more broad-based grains exposure (i.e., including soybeans and corn), JJG , GRU , and WEET (all ETNs) might be worth a closer look. For those in the market for broad exposure to agricultural commodities, there are a number of products in the Agricultural Commodities ETFdb Category that might be useful. Finally, the structure of WEAT should be noted. Because this product is structured as a partnership, investors can expect to receive a K-1 at the end of the year detailing their share of  profits or losses. Moreover, WEAT will be required to buy and sell the underlying futures contracts, which can result in tracking error and trading commissions (meaning that the expense ratio may not include all the fees investors in this fund will pay). While the administrative duties associated with K-1s are minimal, some investors prefer to achieve exposure to commodities through ETNs, which avoid those obligations."}, {"symbol": "DOG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$23.17", "average_volume": "4,102,929", "name": "ProShares Short Dow30", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DOG/", "one_year_return": "-1.36%", "description": "Explore DOG for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "BAMG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$38.28", "average_volume": "38,689", "name": "Brookstone Growth Stock ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/BAMG/", "one_year_return": "-4.61%", "description": "Explore BAMG for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "EFFE", "asset_class": "Multi-Asset", "price": "$24.05", "average_volume": "162", "name": "Harbor Osmosis Emerging Markets Resource Efficient ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/EFFE/", "one_year_return": "4.21%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "GEME", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$35.59", "average_volume": "29,965", "name": "Pacific North of South EM Equity Active ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/GEME/", "one_year_return": "10.60%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "PSTP", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$35.21", "average_volume": "13,632", "name": "Innovator Power Buffer Step-Up Strategy ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/PSTP/", "one_year_return": "-0.41%", "description": "Explore PSTP for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DUNK", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$21.43", "average_volume": "15,057", "name": "Dana Unconstrained Equity ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DUNK/", "one_year_return": "-12.92%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "KLIP", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$29.67", "average_volume": "45,448", "name": "KraneShares KWEB Covered Call Strategy ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/KLIP/", "one_year_return": "0.91%", "description": "Explore KLIP for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "APLY", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$13.06", "average_volume": "184,081", "name": "YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/APLY/", "one_year_return": "0.25%", "description": "Explore APLY for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "IPO", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$41.64", "average_volume": "47,381", "name": "Renaissance IPO ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/IPO/", "one_year_return": "-8.78%", "description": "Explore IPO for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "MFEM", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$25.22", "average_volume": "10,965", "name": "PIMCO RAFI Dynamic Multi-Factor Emerging Markets Equity ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/MFEM/", "one_year_return": "9.08%", "description": "Explore MFEM for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "LPRE", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$27.33", "average_volume": "27,238", "name": "Long Pond Real Estate Select ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/LPRE/", "one_year_return": "2.40%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "XMAG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$22.69", "average_volume": "91,759", "name": "Defiance Large Cap ex-Mag 7 ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/XMAG/", "one_year_return": "0.55%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "SNTH", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$27.47", "average_volume": "48,662", "name": "MRP Synthequity ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SNTH/", "one_year_return": "-0.79%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "YSEP", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$26.58", "average_volume": "26,649", "name": "FT Vest International Equity Moderate Buffer ETF -

It is distinct from other Japanese equity ETFs in that it hedges out the currency exposure that an investment in international stocks brings. This delivers isolated exposure to the performance of the underlying equities in local prices. Currency fluctuations can be a significant driver of gains and losses, and some investors may prefer the potential diversification benefit of exposure to non-U.S. dollar investments. FLJH offers hedged international stock exposure at a reasonable price but it still trails the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Japan ETF ( HEWJ ) in assets and liquidity. FLJH provides broadly similar sector exposure, with a deeper portfolio of mid cap stocks. Investors who expect the U.S. dollar to appreciate relative to the yen might prefer this fund to bet on the performance of Japanese stocks. FLJH should outperform the unhedged iShares MSCI Japan ETF ( EWJ ) when the U.S. currency strengthens. Those expecting the dollar to lose value relative to the yen will probably prefer to leave currency exposure unhedged, utilizing a fund such as EWJ instead. Those investors without a strong view in either direction might use a mix of both hedged and unhedged Japanese equity ETFs (e.g., 50% EWJ and 50% FLJH ). The fund is part of a series of single-country ETFs that Franklin Templeton began rolling out in 2017. The funds debuted with significantly lower management fees than rival iShares funds, which have long dominated the single-country ETF space. Many of the stocks in the fund\u2019s portfolio are likely to be found in diversified international ETFs, and investors should be careful not to take on an unintentional overweight.

The portfolio is weighted in favor of the best performers. ESG (the strategy, not the ticker) is different from traditional socially-responsible investing, which typically tried to exclude bad actors and industries. Many advisers worried that this came at the expense of diversification and returns. So today\u2019s strategies aim to be more inclusive. Instead of ignoring large swathes of the market, the goal is to maintain market-like diversification with a tilt toward the best corporate citizens. The top holdings aren\u2019t that much different than plain-vanilla U.S. stock funds, with holdings like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon. The difference comes down to weighting. It\u2019s worth nothing that there are plenty of skeptics when it comes to ESG investing, and critics say ESG whitewashes a portfolio rather than driving companies to truly change their behavior.

It should be noted that SOCL maintains a global focus, meaning that social media companies in both developed and emerging markets outside the U.S. are included in the underlying portfolio. It should also be noted that SOCL may include companies that maintain significant operations outside of the social media arena ( GOOG is a good example of that situation). The inclusion of these companies may diminish the correlation between SOCL\u2019s price and the success of social media companies. Finally, it is important to know that many social media companies are non-public, meaning that this ETF won\u2019t necessarily include all components of this industry.

This asset class has the potential to offer a significant yield upgrade from Treasuries without exposing investors to the risk that often accompanies high yield bonds. While corporate debt is often included in total bond market ETFs such as AGG and BND , it is noted that allocations are often on the small side. As such, a position in products such as PFIG might make sense as complementary additions to a long-term portfolio. PFIG distinguishes itself from other products in the Corporate Bonds ETFdb Category by the weighting methodology employed by the underlying index. Most bond ETFs are linked to cap weighted indexes that give the largest allocations to the biggest issuers of debt and to the most expensive securities. That approach has multiple potential drawbacks; the biggest debtors receive the highest weightings, and there exists a tendency to overweight overvalued securities. PFIG offers an alternative to cap weighted bond ETFs that may have appeal to investors looking to break the link between security weightings and the level of debt maintained. Rather, PFIG is constructed with the goal of giving the largest weightings to the companies with the greatest ability to service their debt. This is accomplished by scoring issuers based on four fundamental measures of size, including dividends and cash flow. The result is a portfolio that is similar to more popular products such as LQD , but backed by a more sound construction methodology. It should be noted that CBND shares a generally similar objective, but uses slightly different metrics to score the issuers of debt. One potential drawback of PFIG is the slightly above average expense ratio; investors will pay a bit more for the RAFI methodology than they would for LQD . In our mind, however, the additional fee\u2014which is just a few basis points\u2014is well worth the exposure to the superior methodology."}, {"symbol": "CWVX", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$21.69", "average_volume": "2,079,241", "name": "Tradr 2X Long CRWV Daily ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/CWVX/", "one_year_return": "-0.82%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "ZAUG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$26.74", "average_volume": "15,213", "name": "Innovator Equity Defined Protection ETF - 1 Yr August", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/ZAUG/", "one_year_return": "0.10%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "FVC", "asset_class": "Multi-Asset", "price": "$37.09", "average_volume": "5,195", "name": "First Trust Dorsey Wright Dynamic Focus 5 ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FVC/", "one_year_return": "1.99%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "TSEL", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$25.00", "average_volume": "17,754", "name": "Touchstone Sands Capital US Select Growth ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/TSEL/", "one_year_return": "-11.87%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "ESGG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$207.63", "average_volume": "1,033", "name": "FlexShares STOXX Global ESG Select Index Fund", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/ESGG/", "one_year_return": "1.15%", "description": "The FlexShares STOXX Global ESG Impact Index Fund ( ESGG ) tracks a proprietary STOXX index that rates companies based on environmental, social and governance factors that influence risk and return, such as workplace safety, executive compensation, and board diversity. The portfolio is weighted in favor of the best performers. ESG (the strategy, not the ticker) is different from traditional socially-responsible investing, which typically tried to exclude bad actors and industries. Many advisers worried that this came at the expense of diversification and returns. So, today\u2019s ESG strategies aim to be more inclusive. Instead of ignoring large swathes of the market, the goal is to maintain market-like diversification with a tilt toward the best corporate citizens. The top holdings aren\u2019t that much different than plain-vanilla global stock funds, with holdings like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon. The difference comes down to weighting. It\u2019s worth nothing that there are plenty of skeptics when it comes to ESG investing, and critics say ESG whitewashes a portfolio rather than driving companies to truly change their behavior. Issuers have rolled out dozens of ESG -style funds in recent years to appeal to younger investors who are concerned about the social impact of their investments, which means FlexShares has a lot of competition \u2014 especially when it comes to price. ESGG\u2019s management fees are on the high side, especially for investors who don\u2019t mind buying their U.S. and international funds separately.

This one has an international flair. The fund follows a Northern Trust index that selects dividend-paying companies in developed and emerging markets outside the U.S. Simple enough, but then the index weights the portfolio toward companies that earned the highest \u201cdividend quality\u201d scores. To prevent unintentional concentrations, the methodology caps the weighting of individual securities, industry groups, sectors and regions. Lastly, the fund tries to deliver \u201cabove market beta\u201d \u2014 jargon used to describe how volatile performance is relative to the market. It\u2019s another way of saying IQDY targets higher market risk. Investors can be excused for confusing IQDY with its sister funds: FlexShares International Quality Dividend Index Fund ( IQDF ) and the FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund ( IQDE ). Like FlexShares\u2019 domestic variations on the same theme, the three funds are distinguished by their approach to market beta. IQDY aims for a little more risk than the market, IQDE for a little less, and IQDF tries to match it. In practice, all three funds share many of the same top holdings, including Royal Bank of Canada, GlaxoSmithKline and L\u2019Oreal. The difference comes down to weighting, with IQDY leaning a little more on volatile tech stocks than IQDE and IQDF . Many FlexShares funds charge a premium for the Northern Trust expertise, but the FlexShares international dividend ETFs are priced competitively. Still, they are multiples more expensive than plain-vanilla international equity ETFs. Is it worth it? Investors can look at it several different ways. There are other international factor strategies out there, like the Vident International Equity Fund ( VIDI ) or the highly-concentrated (and extremely expensive) First Trust Dorsey Wright International Focus 5 ETF . There are plenty of other international dividend ETFs like the WisdomTree Global ex-U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund ( DNL ), the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF ( DWX ), or the iShares International Select Dividend ETF ( IDV ). There are dividend-focused funds that mix U.S. and international exposure, like the SPDR S&P Global Dividend ETF ( WDIV ) and the GlobalX SuperDividend ETF ( SDIV ). Lastly, investors might want to compare returns and portfolio with an ultra-low-cost international index fund, like the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF ( IXUS ), which lacks fancy factors but offers more liquidity at a fraction of the price."}, {"symbol": "PSMO", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$30.68", "average_volume": "15,363", "name": "Pacer Swan SOS Moderate (October)

This methodology involves a quantitative screening methodology designed to identify the stocks from a specific universe that have the greatest potential for capital appreciation. Specifically, stocks from the eligible universe are ranked on growth factors such as recent price appreciation, sales-to-price ratio, and one year sales growth, and separately on value factors such as book value to price ratio, cash flow to price ratio, and return on assets. Stocks with the highest scores are included in the benchmark, and the highest weightings are afforded larger weightings.

There are also specialized index funds that cover some of the same themes, such as the Global X Cloud Computing ETF ( CLOU ). Ultimately any actively managed fund is a bet on the manager\u2019s ability to outperform the market.

Stocks are screened out based on liquidity, and the index then targets the largest 70% of companies from each eligible country. BKEM is priced competitively with ultra-low-cost rivals like the SPDR Portfolio Emerging Markets ETF ( SPEM ), the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ( IEMG ), the Charles Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF ( SCHE ), and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF ( VWO ). As a result of its methodology, BKEM owns a smaller universe of securities than those funds, and tilts more heavily toward large cap stocks. Another important consideration is that BKEM , like IEMG , includes South Korea. By contrast, VEA , SPDW , and SCHF exclude South Korea, classifying it instead with developed markets.

Issuers have rolled out dozens of ESG -style funds in recent years to appeal to younger investors who are concerned about the social impact of their investments. ESG (the strategy, not the ticker) is different from traditional socially-responsible investing, which typically tried to exclude bad actors and industries.

Instead of ignoring large swathes of the market, the goal is maintain market-like diversification with a tilt toward the best corporate citizens. It\u2019s worth nothing that there are plenty of skeptics when it comes to ESG investing, and critics say ESG whitewashes a portfolio rather than driving companies to truly change their behavior. Investors who prefer plain-vanilla ETFs can take a look at funds like IEFA or the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF ( VEA )."}, {"symbol": "MAYW", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$33.63", "average_volume": "2,241", "name": "AllianzIM U.S. Equity Buffer20 May ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/MAYW/", "one_year_return": "0.26%", "description": "Explore MAYW for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "VIXM", "asset_class": "Volatility", "price": "$15.64", "average_volume": "231,030", "name": "ProShares VIX Mid-Term Futures ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/VIXM/", "one_year_return": "2.42%", "description": "Explore VIXM for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DIVL", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$24.86", "average_volume": "3,476", "name": "Madison Dividend Value ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DIVL/", "one_year_return": "8.57%", "description": "Explore DIVL for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "NORW", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$32.22", "average_volume": "11,679", "name": "Global X MSCI Norway ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/NORW/", "one_year_return": "7.24%", "description": "Explore NORW for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "EMC", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$32.40", "average_volume": "18,752", "name": "Global X Emerging Markets Great Consumer ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/EMC/", "one_year_return": "5.39%", "description": "Explore EMC for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "JANT", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$41.06", "average_volume": "11,038", "name": "AllianzIM U.S. Equity Buffer10 Jan ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/JANT/", "one_year_return": "-0.42%", "description": "Explore JANT for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "PHDG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$37.72", "average_volume": "6,302", "name": "Invesco S&P 500\u00ae Downside Hedged ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/PHDG/", "one_year_return": "0.75%", "description": "Explore PHDG for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "PRXV", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$32.02", "average_volume": "8,341", "name": "Praxis Impact Large Cap Value ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/PRXV/", "one_year_return": "5.61%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "QUIZ", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$28.04", "average_volume": "27,071", "name": "Zacks Quality International ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/QUIZ/", "one_year_return": "5.72%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "CNXT", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$44.77", "average_volume": "35,970", "name": "VanEck ChiNext ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/CNXT/", "one_year_return": "2.28%", "description": "Explore CNXT for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "BKSE", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$117.87", "average_volume": "2,733", "name": "BNY Mellon US Small Cap Core Equity ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/BKSE/", "one_year_return": "4.77%", "description": "The BNY Mellon US Small Cap Core Equity ETF ( BKSE ) tracks an index of hundreds of small cap U.S. stocks, including REITs. BKSE\u2019s index methodology first screens for liquidity. The index is composed of companies whose cumulative total market capitalization represents approximately the bottom 3% to 10% of the remaining securities. The investment thesis behind a small cap investment is the growth factor that comes along with these securities. While mega cap firms have already hit their peak, smaller companies may be the next juggernaut. The downside to small cap investing is additional risk. Changes in regulation, credit availability, or product viability could send share prices plummeting. While some exposure to these small companies is healthy for a portfolio, the allocation should be kept relatively low since this market segment experiences extreme volatility. Investors in total-market ETFs already have some allocation to small caps and should ensure they are not unintentionally overweighting a risky space. Conversely, investors with strong convictions about small caps might want to augment a total market fund with a targeted small cap fund. BKSE is priced to match or beat rivals like the iShares Core S&P Small Cap ETF ( IJR ) or the SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap ETF ( SPSM ). BKSE is part of a lineup of ETFs introduced by BNY Mellon in April 2020.

Since most portfolios don\u2019t include an allocation to international junk bonds, IHY offers a way to potentially add to the depth of a portfolio and bring some diversification benefits as well. There are a couple noteworthy aspects of IHY . First, the portfolio includes both developed and emerging markets. It should also be noted that the portfolio is split between dollar denominated bonds and those denominated in other currencies, thereby bringing some exchange rate risk but also currency diversification. Overall, IHY maintains a balanced portfolio that spreads holdings around multiple currencies, countries, sectors, and durations. IHY could be useful as a component of a long-term portfolio, bringing enhancements to the current return portion.

Given the narrow focus of KBWR , this fund might be most useful for investors looking to implement a shorter term tactical tilt towards this corner of the market, though it can certainly also be used as a component of a long-term portfolio as well. KBWR\u2019s portfolio is unique from the most popular ETFs in the Financials Equities ETFdb Category; this ETF is designed to focus on firms that do business as regional banks or thrifts, and as such does not include Wall Street titans that make up funds such as XLF . Moreover, it should be noted that these smaller regional banks often maintain risk/return profiles that differ considerably from their large cap peers; though impacted by some of the same factors, regional banks generally depend more heavily on traditional banking functions to drive profits. KBWR\u2019s portfolio is reasonably deep, consisting of about 50 individual holdings. And this ETF features a nice degree of balance as well; no one name accounts for a huge portion of assets. For investors looking to target this corner of the market, the competitive expense ratio and balanced portfolio make KBWR a potentially appealing option. Alternative ETPs covering the same corner of the market include KRE (which is linked to an equal-weighted index) and IAT , while ProShares offers a pair of leveraged ETFs targeting regional banks ( KRS , KRU )."}, {"symbol": "BETZ", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$17.98", "average_volume": "17,302", "name": "Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/BETZ/", "one_year_return": "-14.30%", "description": "Explore BETZ for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "VUSV", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "N/A", "average_volume": "N/A", "name": "Vanguard Wellington U.S. Value Active ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/VUSV/", "one_year_return": "N/A", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "DECM", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$32.85", "average_volume": "20,860", "name": "FT Vest U.S. Equity Max Buffer ETF -

The fund holds about 50 securities but grants most of that exposure to the top ten, with that select group accounting for well over half of total assets.

Digging deeper into the holdings, investors will find that the fund has a nice diversity as far as market cap spread is concerned, with companies of all sizes given equitable representation.

This methodology involves a quantitative screening methodology designed to identify the stocks from a specific universe that have the greatest potential for capital appreciation. Specifically, stocks from the eligible universe are ranked on growth factors such as recent price appreciation, sales-to-price ratio, and one year sales growth, and separately on value factors such as book value to price ratio, cash flow to price ratio, and return on assets. Stocks with the highest scores are included in the benchmark, and the highest weightings are afforded larger weightings. For those looking to make a play on Swiss equities, FSZ certainly makes for a viable option, but it is on the upper range of expenses; you pay a premium for the strategy which has proven itself under numerous market environments. Switzerland\u2019s economy has long been known for its stability and neutrality on international affairs, giving credence to FSZ . The ETF has a portfolio of 40 stocks with around 40% of assets going to the top ten securities; while that isn\u2019t the best diversity in the space, it certainly is not the worst. FSZ would probably not be used as a core holding in a portfolio, but can be a great tool for segmenting Swiss stocks as a satellite holding of a bigger portfolio."}, {"symbol": "ASIA", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$35.98", "average_volume": "2,633", "name": "Matthews Pacific Tiger Active ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/ASIA/", "one_year_return": "5.29%", "description": "Explore ASIA for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "FIAT", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$35.34", "average_volume": "137,573", "name": "YieldMax Short COIN Option Income Strategy ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FIAT/", "one_year_return": "29.73%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "OVB", "asset_class": "Bond", "price": "$20.56", "average_volume": "17,671", "name": "Overlay Shares Core Bond ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/OVB/", "one_year_return": "0.68%", "description": "Explore OVB for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "TSLG", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$7.07", "average_volume": "19,874,107", "name": "Leverage Shares 2X Long TSLA Daily ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/TSLG/", "one_year_return": "-24.14%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "NXTE", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$40.35", "average_volume": "3,978", "name": "AXS Green Alpha ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/NXTE/", "one_year_return": "4.58%", "description": "Explore NXTE for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "PSFO", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$32.32", "average_volume": "12,571", "name": "Pacer Swan SOS Flex (October) ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/PSFO/", "one_year_return": "-0.24%", "description": "Explore PSFO for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "PAWZ", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$55.06", "average_volume": "4,530", "name": "ProShares Pet Care ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/PAWZ/", "one_year_return": "0.72%", "description": "Explore PAWZ for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "NETL", "asset_class": "Real Estate", "price": "$25.70", "average_volume": "11,790", "name": "Colterpoint Net Lease Real Estate ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/NETL/", "one_year_return": "8.77%", "description": "Explore NETL for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "REIT", "asset_class": "Real Estate", "price": "$27.37", "average_volume": "9,059", "name": "ALPS Active REIT ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/REIT/", "one_year_return": "4.18%", "description": "Explore REIT for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DURA", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$37.18", "average_volume": "3,097", "name": "VanEck Durable High Dividend ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DURA/", "one_year_return": "10.03%", "description": "Explore DURA for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "FMET", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$33.08", "average_volume": "7,233", "name": "Fidelity Metaverse ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/FMET/", "one_year_return": "-8.29%", "description": "Explore FMET for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "ASCE", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$27.86", "average_volume": "12,292", "name": "Allspring SMID Core ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/ASCE/", "one_year_return": "3.84%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "NTSE", "asset_class": "Multi-Asset", "price": "$40.67", "average_volume": "8,600", "name": "WisdomTree Emerging Markets Efficient Core Fund", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/NTSE/", "one_year_return": "7.78%", "description": "Explore NTSE for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "CORN", "asset_class": "Commodity", "price": "$17.59", "average_volume": "53,344", "name": "Teucrium Corn Fund", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/CORN/", "one_year_return": "-0.76%", "description": "Explore CORN for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "CVNY", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$31.75", "average_volume": "57,517", "name": "YieldMax CVNA Option Income Strategy ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/CVNY/", "one_year_return": "-9.16%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "XJUL", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$39.10", "average_volume": "3,860", "name": "FT Vest U.S. Equity Enhance & Moderate Buffer ETF -

FLGR offers broadly similar exposure to the iShares MSCI Germany ETF ( EWG ), with a slightly deeper portfolio and more exposure to mid cap stocks. FLGR\u2019s management fee is a fraction of the price of EWG , but it trails its iShares rival in assets and liquidity. The fund is part of a series of single-country ETFs that Franklin Templeton began rolling out in 2017. The funds debuted with significantly lower management fees than rival iShares funds, which have long dominated the single-country ETF space. Many of the stocks in the fund\u2019s portfolio are likely to be found in regional ETFs as well as emerging- and developed-market funds, and investors should be careful not to take on an unintentional overweight. Single-country funds are typically not appropriate for investors seeking a diversified portfolio and are more appealing to short-term traders placing tactical bets on specific markets. Given the relatively narrow country-specific focus of this ETF , FLGR may be most useful to those looking to establish a tactical tilt towards Germany or implementing a country rotation strategy."},

Credit-Scored U.S. Long Corporate Bond Index Fund ( LKOR ) follows a proprietary index of investment-grade debt with maturities of 10 years or longer, but with a twist characteristic of Northern Trust\u2019s FlexShares lineup. The index scores bonds by evaluating the issuers\u2019 value and quality by looking at measures like solvency, profitability, and management efficiency. The index weights the portfolio towards those with the highest scores while those with the worst performance are excluded. Then, to preserve diversification, the methodology limits the weight of individual bonds, issuers, sectors, duration and turnover. Like many FlexShares funds, investors pay a premium for Northern Trust\u2019s fancy factors. Is it worth it? We compared performance to a few long-term corporate bond ETFs that charge a fraction of LKOR\u2019s management fee, such as the Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF ( VCLT ) or the iShares Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF ( IGLB ). LKOR beat them both. It also outperformed the iShares Edge Investment Grade Enhanced Bond ETF ( IGEB ), which also tries to mitigate risk by focussing on quality on value.

strategy that may otherwise be out of reach.

The fund has the flexibility to establish long or short exposure to most of these factors (long or flat to some) based on a proprietary quantitative analysis. It\u2019s important for investors to realize what hedge fund replication strategies entail, and the limitations to such techniques. HDG doesn\u2019t have access to all the same tools as famous hedge fund managers, and shouldn\u2019t be confused with a product that will seek to generate huge absolute returns in any environment. Instead, the primary appeal of this product may be in its ability to offer non-correlated returns, adding diversification benefits to traditional stock-and-bond portfolios and smoothing overall volatility. The exposure offered by HDG would be quite expensive and demanding for most investors to establish; this ETF offers a way to access this advanced and potentially time-consuming strategy at a relatively low price point.

TTT can also be a way for betting against bonds in anticipation of strong equity market performance. It should be noted that TTT is an extremely risky product that utilizes leverage in order to magnify the results delivered. This product is certainly not constructed with buy-and-holders in mind; rather, TTT is more useful for sophisticated investors willing and able to take on a significant amount of risk. It\u2019s important to understand that TTT features a daily reset of exposure, which results in unpredictable returns over longer period of times and means that TTT will be impacted by both the direction and volatility of the underlying index.

Because rising interest rates often accompany jumps in inflation, the ability of this asset class to protect against rising prices may be limited. RINF taks a unique approach; because it consists of long and short positions in assets with approximately equal durations, the interest rate component is removed. That essentially isolates inflation expectations as the source of returns; if the market\u2019s expectations for inflation rise, TIPS will outperform otherwise comparable Treasuries and RINF will appreciate. This is a relatively complex ETF , and may not be appropriate for all investors. But if you\u2019re interested in making a bet on increasing expectations for inflation, RINF offers a unique way to isolate these risk factors."}, {"symbol": "BCSM", "asset_class": "Equity", "price":

Because the materials sector generally accounts for a relatively small allocation within broad-based equity ETFs, some investors may be interested in adding this ETF to a long-term portfolio. PSCM may also be useful for establishing a tactical tilt towards the materials sector, and can be useful as part of a sector rotation strategy. Unlike most of the other materials ETFs available to U.S. investors, PSCM focuses primarily on small cap stocks; funds such as XLB are generally dominated by large cap stocks in comparison. While these groups of companies are impacted by many of the same factors, there can be some significant differences in the risk/return profiles as well; small caps will generally feature greater volatility, but may offer greater potential for capital appreciation over the long run. The small cap approach may have other benefits as well. PSCM , for example, features a relatively balanced portfolio; no one stocks accounts for a huge percentage of assets. XLB , on the other hand, has close to 10% of its assets in a handful of different stocks, and the top ten components account for well more than half of the total portfolio. For investors looking to establish materials exposure, this ETF is worth a close look; the balance of holdings and efficient cost structure make it one of many good options out there."}, {"symbol": "LOCT", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$23.82", "average_volume": "3,592", "name": "Innovator Premium Income 15 Buffer ETF -

Investors seeking more broad-based exposure to commodities have a number of options in the Commodities ETFdb Category ( DJCI and USCI are a couple of our favorites). It is important to note that CANE does not offer exposure to spot sugar prices; this product invests in sugar futures, and as such the slope of the futures curve will have a potentially significant impact on returns and volatility realized. For more sophisticated investors looking to make a play on sugar, CANE can be a very efficient way to achieve low maintenance access to this corner of the commodity market. One of the more noteworthy attributes of this product is the manner in which the underlying futures contracts are structured and maintained; rather than simply rolling exposure to front month futures contracts upon expiration, holdings are spread across multiple maturities in a manner designed to minimize the adverse impact of contango on bottom line returns. There are other ETP options for gaining access to sugar; iPath offers SGG and SGAR , both of which are structured as ETNs, and each of which offers a unique roll methodology. The ETN structure exposes investors to the credit risk of the issuing institution, but also has certain advantages in the commodity space, including tax efficiencies and elimination of commissions."}, {"symbol": "VNSE", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$38.55", "average_volume": "283", "name": "Natixis Vaughan Nelson Select ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/VNSE/", "one_year_return": "0.30%", "description": "Explore VNSE for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "BETH", "asset_class": "Currency", "price": "$35.83", "average_volume": "7,476", "name": "ProShares Bitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/BETH/", "one_year_return": "-29.79%", "description": "Explore BETH for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "ARCX", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$25.14", "average_volume": "60,924", "name": "Tradr 2X Long ACHR Daily ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/ARCX/", "one_year_return": "-29.85%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "DULL", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$1.07", "average_volume": "742,275", "name": "MicroSectors Gold -3X Inverse Leveraged ETNs", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DULL/", "one_year_return": "-36.31%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "QQQS", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$33.97", "average_volume": "6,170", "name": "Invesco NASDAQ Future Gen 200 ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/QQQS/", "one_year_return": "-0.36%", "description": "Explore QQQS for FREE on ETFdb.com: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DUKQ", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$27.95", "average_volume": "2,754", "name": "Ocean Park Domestic ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DUKQ/", "one_year_return": "0.30%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "VWID", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$37.47", "average_volume": "1,046", "name": "Virtus WMC International Dividend ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/VWID/", "one_year_return": "4.75%", "description": "Explore VWID for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DECO", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$43.90", "average_volume": "1,305", "name": "SPDR Galaxy Digital Asset Ecosystem ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DECO/", "one_year_return": "-3.39%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "IMST", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$9.29", "average_volume": "38,497", "name": "Bitwise MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/IMST/", "one_year_return": "-22.98%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "PSCU", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$56.42", "average_volume": "917", "name": "Invesco S&P SmallCap Utilities & Communication Services ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/PSCU/", "one_year_return": "-1.89%", "description": "This ETF is one of several within the Utilities ETFdb Category that offers targeted exposure to this sector of the U.S. economy.

Given the sector-specific focus, this ETF might be more appealing to those with a specific outlook on utilities, as opposed to those looking to build a longer-term, buy-and-hold portfolio. PSCU is unique because this fund focuses on small cap stocks; most utilities ETFs are dominated by positions in large cap names (and mid caps to a lesser extent). While large cap and small cap utilities will be impacted by many of the same price drivers, these asset classes often show very unique risk/return profiles. Small caps will generally offer greater potential for capital appreciation, but may experience greater volatility as well. Investors looking for large cap utilities exposure have a number of options available, including XLU , VPU , and the equal-weighted RYU . It should also be noted that this small cap ETF includes some telecom stocks, as these equities generally exhibit similar returns and volatility as utilities (many technology sector ETFs include telecom stocks under that umbrella)."}, {"symbol": "CLCV", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$27.24", "average_volume": "3,249", "name": "Crossmark Large Cap Value ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/CLCV/", "one_year_return": "2.37%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "SZNE", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$36.94", "average_volume": "1,176", "name": "Pacer CFRA-Stovall Equal Weight Seasonal Rotation ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/SZNE/", "one_year_return": "5.82%", "description": "Explore SZNE for FREE on ETF Database: Price, Holdings, Charts, Technicals, Fact Sheet, News, and more."}, {"symbol": "DJTU", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$2.50", "average_volume": "1,271,329", "name": "T-REX 2X Long DJT Daily Target ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/DJTU/", "one_year_return": "-36.39%", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "GOLS", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "N/A", "average_volume": "N/A", "name": "Gabelli Opportunities in Live and Sports ETF", "url": "https://etfdb.com/etf/GOLS/", "one_year_return": "N/A", "description": ""}, {"symbol": "RULE", "asset_class": "Multi-Asset", "price": "$24.56", "average_volume": "1,067", "name": "Collaborative Investment Series Trust -

While TAGS might not have tremendous appeal in a long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio, it can be an efficient tool for those looking to establish tactical exposure to this corner of the market. There are several noteworthy attributes about TAGS . First, the underlying holdings of this ETF are actually other ETFs offered by Teucrium. Those ETFs in turn hold futures contracts linked to the actual commodities. As such, it should be noted that TAGS will not necessarily reflect movements in spot prices of the underlying commodities, but rather the performance of a futures-based strategy (meaning that the slope of the futures curve will impact returns). It should also be noted that TAGS maintains a considerably more focused portfolio than many other agricultural commodity ETFs; this fund focuses on the four primary agricultural commodities, without diversifying into other resources."}, {"symbol": "CPRA", "asset_class": "Equity", "price": "$26.67", "average_volume": "998", "name": "Calamos Russell 2000 Structured Alt Protection ETF - April",

Deutsche Bank has delisted dozens of its ETNs in recent years, but other zombie ETNs continue to limp around the market.
